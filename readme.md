# ![WARNING: *VULNERABLE* RealWorld Example App](logo.png)

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/alisabzevari/kotlin-http4k-realworld-example-app/_apis/build/status/alisabzevari.kotlin-http4k-realworld-example-app?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/alisabzevari/kotlin-http4k-realworld-example-app/_build/latest?definitionId=1&branchName=master)

> ### Kotlin + http4k codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with Kotlin + http4k + Exposed including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.

# How it works

The application was made mainly to demo the functionality of http4k framework together with exposed.

## Tech stack
The application was built with:

* [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org) as programming language.
* [http4k](https://http4k.org) as web framework.
* [h2](https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html), an embedded lightweight database, as data storage. Although the application can support all the databases supported by exposed.
* [exposed](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed) to access database and build typesafe SQL queries.
* [jsonwebtoken](https://github.com/jwtk/jjwt) to handle JSON Web Tokens for request authorization.
* [log4j](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/) for proper logging in the application.
* [kotlintest](https://github.com/kotlintest/kotlintest) as testing framework for kotlin.
* [mockk](https://mockk.io/) as mocking library for Kotlin.

## Application structure

Basically, the application has four main parts:
* `main` function which instantiates all the services and handlers and connects them together, then starts the server.
* `Router` class which handles the translation of 1. http requests to request handler calls and 2. handler results to http responses. Authorization logic is also implemented in this class.
* `handler` package which contains a class for every request handler. Handlers are classes with one method (`invoke`) which handles the request. This package contains the whole business logic of the application. Handlers have access to data layer.
* `ConduitRepository` class which is responsible for building database queries. In order to communicate to database, a class called `ConduitTransactionManagerImpl` is needed. this class has one method (`tx`) which connects to database and opens a transaction to communicate with database. `tx` accepts an anonymous function while provides an instance of `ConduitRepository` as a receiver.

```

## Database

The application currently uses H2 embedded database. The connection is defined in `config/local.kt`. If you want to change the database you need to provide the correct dependency for the driver and change the configuration. 

## Tests

You can run `./gradlew test` to run all the tests. A test logger gradle plugin (`com.adarshr.test-logger`) has used to render the test beautifully in console.
There are a couple of unit tests for handlers but not for all of them (contributions welcome!).
There are integration tests to cover all the cases of the postman test file.

# Getting started

You need Java 11 installed.

**Build and run tests:**
```
./gradlew clean build
```

**Start the server:**
```
./gradlew run
```
The server will be available on `http://localhost:9000`
